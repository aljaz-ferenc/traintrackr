# TrainTrackr

## Fitness and Nutrition Tracker

TrainTrackr allows users to plan and track their workouts structured into mesocycles. The app shows you the exact workout to perform each day based on your plan. Every session is saved for easy progress tracking.

Users can also save custom food items with accurate nutrition values, and quickly calculate daily and weekly averages as well as macronutrients.

By combining nutrition tracking, body weight monitoring, and workout progress, you can clearly see whether your plan is working or needs adjustment.

- **Dashboard**: Once you start tracking your progress, the dashboard will display:
  - Your daily and weekly calorie intake, averages, and macronutrients
  - Weight tracking with a chart showing daily changes
  - Mesocycle progress, including completed or missed workouts (requires an active mesocycle)

3. Workout
    - When a mesocycle is active, the app shows your scheduled workout for the day. For each exercise, you can log sets with weight and reps performed.
    - When you're done with your workout, click `Complete Workout` and you will be redirected to `Completed Workouts`.
    - There you can review every exercise and rep youâ€™ve logged for reference and progress tracking.

## Measurements
On the `Measurements` page, you can log your body weight once per day and record measurements for different body parts. This data is used to calculate weight changes on the `Dashboard`.

### Recommendation
Track your nutrition and body weight every day. This way, you will know exactly how your weight changes and how many calories you are consuming, so you can adjust your intake to gain or lose weight as desired.
